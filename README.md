Junior developer exploring my passion 😊

Second-year CS student at HSE University (Moscow) 🎓

I dove into programming fairly recently and am actively experimenting with different areas—currently most excited about algorithms and game development/design. 🎮

Strong math background from school: multiple awards in national/international math olympiads and specialized STEM education. 📈

This GitHub hosts some of my small projects and coursework—feel free to explore! 🕶️
