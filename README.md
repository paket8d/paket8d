Junior developer exploring my passion :)
Second-year CS student at HSE University (Moscow).
I dove into programming fairly recently and am actively experimenting with different areasâ€”currently most excited about algorithms and game development/design.

Strong math background from school: multiple awards in national/international math olympiads and specialized STEM education.

This GitHub hosts some of my small projects and courseworkâ€”feel free to explore!
